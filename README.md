# India-Air-Quality-Analysis
This project analyzes Air Quality Index (AQI) across major Indian cities to understand pollution levels, seasonal changes, and harmful pollutants like PM2.5, PM10, SO₂, NO₂, O₃.


# Top 6 Key Findings from AQI Data Analysi

1️⃣ Particulate Matter (PM2.5 & PM10) is the dominant driver of AQI
Correlation heatmap shows very strong correlation with AQI (≈ 0.92)
This pattern is consistent across cities and years


2️⃣ Delhi consistently experiences worse air quality than Mumbai
Monthly trend graphs (2018–2020) show Delhi’s AQI is higher in almost every month
Winter AQI peaks in Delhi exceed 350–400, while Mumbai remains significantly lower


3️⃣ Winter months show the worst AQI across all cities
AQI sharply increases during October–January
Clear seasonal spike visible in Delhi and Jaipur across multiple years


4️⃣ Monsoon season significantly improves air quality
AQI drops to its lowest levels during July–September
Rainfall effectively reduces particulate concentration


5️⃣ Vehicular and industrial emissions have a strong secondary impact
Nitrogen Oxides (NO, NO₂, NOx) show moderate to strong correlation with AQI (≈ 0.58–0.66)
Strong inter-correlation among NO pollutants


6️⃣ City-wise AQI variation highlights uneven pollution exposure
2020 city-wise bar chart shows large AQI differences across Indian cities
Metro and industrial cities consistently record higher AQI than coastal or smaller cities


# One-Line Overall Conclusion
The analysis confirms that particulate matter is the primary contributor to poor air quality in Indian cities, with strong seasonal and city-wise variations, and Delhi consistently facing the most severe pollution levels.
